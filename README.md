# Motive ❤️ 
So behind construction of this custom tab bar was to use the property and feature of tabbar with minimal view hinderance. Usually tab bar used to take a wide portion of 
area on the screen. So by using this tab bar you can reduce the area coverage by 3/4 of the old version . The tab bar consists of various animation and features.
